## 👤 Who I Am 


I'm Badri a passionate robotics engineer working at the intersection of **ML, autonomy, and embedded systems**.   

I'm currently pursuing my MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Machine Learning) at the University of Southern California.

I care deeply about building **intelligent robotic systems that are safe, reliable, predictable, and deployable** - from hardware bring-up & firmware to perception, control, and learning-based decision-making.

- ⚙️ Previously built & delivered **electric motorcycles** and **6-wheel autonomous UGV platforms** (electronics, braking control, firmware, PCB design).

- ⚡ Deep fascination towards **robot learning, autonomy stacks, and edge ML** 

------------------------------------   
## 🚀 What I Work On

- 🧠 **NeuroAI & Brain–Machine Learning**  

Contrastive alignment of intracranial EEG with audiovisual stimulus embeddings using transformer encoders + Kalman-inspired priors (EE 675 @ USC).

- 🤖 **Robot Learning & Control**  

RL + BC pipelines for autonomous driving, closed-loop control, and multimodal policy learning (CSCI 699 @ USC).

- 📡 **Wi-Fi Power & Traffic ML**  

ML models for burst qualification & prediction to guide intelligent DTIM sleep transitions for power savings (Qualcomm Internship).

- ⚡ **EVs & Autonomous UGVs**  

Former Senior EE for 6-wheel autonomous UGV platforms & performance electric motorcycles. Developed braking controls firmware, EE subsystems, vehicle wiring, sensor integration, and PCB designs.

------------------------------------
